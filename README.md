Welcome to the Maple Tracker! This is a tracking application used to keep track of your character and their dailies/weeklies. 

This application will track the reset times appropriately and reset all actions when a reset happens! It also supports temporary actions that will be removed when you specify them (They are in terms of UTC).

This program saves the data to a file when the application is closed. There may be room for auto saving every so often in the future if the need is there.
